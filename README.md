## USING OMNISCAPE TO ANALYZE LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY FOR ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT
This is a term paper which uses omniscape to analyse connectivity between landscape elements.
This study examines the connectivity within the landscape and its significance for fostering a
thriving ecosystem in the ELM region, a forested hill range situated at 52.226°N latitude and
10.856°E longitude in southwest Lower Saxony, Central Germany. This research was
conducted as part of the FInAL project from October 2022 to January 2023, with a focus on
the impact of built-up areas, farms, rivers, and forests on landscape elements.
The primary objective of this work was to understand how the connectivity of different
landscape components facilitates animal movement, a crucial factor in nature conservation
efforts.
The Omniscape algorithm was employed to examine each spot within the study area. This
approach identified areas where animals can move with ease and areas where their movement
is hindered by obstacles such as buildings or roads. Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS Collection 2 satellite
imagery data collected over the study period was transformed into a resistance file using the
respective bands converted into a multiband raster. Omniscape analysis generated maps of
cumulative current flow, flow potential, and normalized current flow.
The normalized current flow map revealed that farm areas and built-up areas, with a
threshold value less than 1.0, act as barriers to animal movement. The study underscores the
importance of maintaining connectivity in natural areas to ensure unrestricted animal
movement. It was observed that animals can move efficiently in forests and along rivers. This
research highlights the need for strategic planning in landscape management to promote
biodiversity.
